// calculate the number of seconds from start of day (port value is
// 16*number of seconds from midnight). Rounds seconds up if there at
// least 8/16 have passed. Uses shifts and masks for this calculation
// to be efficient. Then uses division on the seconds since the
// begining of the day to calculate the time of day broken into hours,
// minutes, seconds, and sets the AM/PM designation with 1 for AM and
// 2 for PM. By the end, all fields of the `tod` struct are filled in
